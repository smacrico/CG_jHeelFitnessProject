## The script will:

Process all FIT files in the activitiesTest folder
Store HRV data in the astremis_hrv.db database
Create analysis views
Provide HRV trend analysis

## Key features:

FIT file parsing
Data storage in SQLite database
Daily HRV summaries
Trend analysis
Recovery score calculation
Comprehensive logging


### Key changes from the previous version:

Replaced SQLAlchemy with direct SQLite3 queries
Simplified database connection handling
Hardcoded SQL queries
Direct table creation and management
Simplified error handling
Maintained all functionality but with pure SQLite implementation

## The script will still:

Process all FIT files in the activitiesTest folder
Store HRV data in the astremis_hrv.db database
Create analysis views
Provide HRV trend analysis

## gert data from artemis_hrv table vcreated by f3b v5.0 script
Key changes made to the code:

Added MySQL database connectivity using mysql.connector
Removed the add_session method since data is now fetched from the database
Added a load_data_from_db method to fetch data from the hrv_sessionsDEV table
Added error handling for database operations
Added a generate_summary_stats method for additional statistical analysis
Modified the main function to showcase all available functionality
Maintained all existing visualization and analysis capabilities

## important noted

Update the database configuration in the db_config dictionary with your actual database credentials:


host
database name (currently set to 'artemis_hrv')
username
password


Make sure your hrv_sessionsDEV table has all the required columns:


date
sd1
sd2
sdnn
mean_rr
mean_hr
rmssd
pnn50
vlf
lf
hf
lf_nu
hf_nu

The code will automatically calculate derived metrics like sd2_sd1_ratio and lf_hf_ratio from the base measurements.
